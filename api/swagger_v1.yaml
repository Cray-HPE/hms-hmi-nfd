    Nodes like compute nodes or user access nodes may want to be notified when
    other nodes or components in the system change state. For example, in a
    booted system, a node may be in tight communication with other nodes in the
    system and need to be notified when any of those nodes go away.

    The HMS Notification Fanout Daemon (HMNFD) provides the Hardware State
    Manager with the capability of fanning out state change notifications to
    subscribing compute nodes. HMNFD provides the ability to notify subscribers
    of component hardware state changes and other changes made to and by the
    Hardware State Manager.

    To receive notifications, a compute node must have an http or https based HMNFD API
    endpoint service running. This is where the State Change Notifications will
    be sent when they occur. HMNFD works with the Hardware State Manager and
    distributes state changes and manages subscriptions.


    The REST API provides the following functions:

    * Subscription for component state changes:
        * Hardware state (On, Off, Ready, Standby, Halt etc.)
        * Logical state (arbitrary like AdminDown, Other)
        * Role (Compute, Management, Application etc.)
        * Enabled state
        * Flag (OK, Alert, Warning, etc.)

    * View current subscriptions

    * Delete subscriptions

    * Retrieve and modify current service operating parameters

    * Create state change notifications for distribution to subscribers

    ## Deprecation Notice: V1 of the HMS service has been deprecated as of CSM version 1.2.0. 
    The V1 HMNFD APIâ€™s will be removed in the CSM version 1.5 release.
    All consumers of the V1 HMNFD API interface will need to move to the V2 interface prior to the CSM 1.5 release.

    ## Resources

    ### /subscribe

    Subscribe to notifications. This resource is generally used by compute
    nodes.

    ### /unsubscribe

    Unsubscribe from notifications. This resource is generally used by compute
    nodes.

    ### /subscriptions

    View all current subscriptions. This resource is generally used by compute
    nodes.

    ### /scn

    State change notification messages sent from Hardware State Manager to
    HMNFD; the same format is used for notifications sent by HMNFD to
    subscribers. This resource applies only to the HSM.

    ### /params

    Retrieve or update configurable parameters.

    ### /health

    Retrieve health information for the service and its dependencies.

    ## Workflows

    ### Retrieve and Delete Subscriptions

    #### GET /subscriptions

    Retrieve and view current subscriptions.

    #### DELETE /subscribe

    Delete subscriptions that are not needed.

    ### Subscribe to State Change Notifications

    #### POST /subscribe

    A node will subscribe to whatever state change notifications (SCNs) it wants
    to receive. Thus, the node needs to have a service running to which NFD can
    send, via REST, the subscribed-to SCNs. A URL that tells where to send the
    SCNs is provided as part of the request body schema. Once a subscribed-to
    SCN occurs, NFD sends it to the node's service via a REST call to the URL
    supplied during the subscribe operation.

    ### Update Service Configurable Parameters

    #### GET /params

    Fetch a JSON-formatted list of current configurable parameters.

    #### PATCH /params

    Change the value of one or more configurable parameters.

        The `health` resource returns health information about the HMNFD service
        and its dependencies.  This actively checks the connection between 
        HMNFD and the following:
          * KV Store
          * Message Bus
          * Worker Pool


        This is primarily intended as a diagnostic tool to investigate the
        functioning of the HMNFD service.
